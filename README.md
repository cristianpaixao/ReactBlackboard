# ReactBlackboard
A Blackboard created using react

I've created this virtual whiteboard to use when i need to explain something on a call, though you can use it to give lessons or whatever other use you may need.

Just making it clear, this is not a react component, but it's a complete project. Obviously, this does not rule out the possibility of you using the code of this project in your own projects.

## Packages
I've used only a package: `file-saver`

Anyway, this project was created using React and javascript (ES6 Specifications)

## Running it
To run the project, it's pretty simple:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
2. Install the packages using: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the project using: `npm start` or `yarn start`

* I'll create a dockerfile soon to make deploy easier

## Using it
It's Simple, draw!

# ToDo
